      <center><h2> C programming</h2></center>
      <p>C is a powerful general-purpose programming language. It can be used to develop software like operating systems, databases, compilers, and so on. C programming is an excellent language to learn and to program for beginners. It was developed by Dennis Ritchie in 1972 at Bell lab. It is procedural language which means that people can write their program as a series of step by step instructions.</p>
     <h4>  Professor : Dr. Anirban Choudhary</h4>
         <p>As I'm from BCA background, i have already studied C but there i had got only theoretical knowledege and coding, but in MCA I've many more expections now like to learn C language in deep and get the practical knowledege also which yes i'm getting by my Professor Anirban Sir.</p>

      <center><h2>Operating system</h2></center>
      <p>An operating system is the interface between the user and the computer hardware.it is a system software that manages computer hardware,software resource and provide common service for computer programs. for hardware functions such as input and output and memory allocation. it acts as a intermediate between programs and the commputer hardware although the application code is usually executed directly by the hardware and frequently makes system calls to an operating function.</p>
      <h4> Professor : Dr Vishnu Priya </h4>
   <p> In Bca, I've got basic knowledge of OS, and here in MCA my expections is to get more but if the same then in the deep.</p>

      <center><h2> Data structure</h2></center>
      <p> A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.In computer science, a data structure is a data organization, management, and storage format that enables efficient access and modification. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. </p>
      <h4> Professor : Dr Amit Bhagat</h4>
   <p>As I'm from BCA background, I've already studied Data Structure but there I'd got only basic knowledge of Data Structure but here in MCA, my expectations is to know more for more doing applications.</p>

   <center> <h2>Computer architecture and organisation </h2></center>
   <p> computer architecture is a set of rules and methods that describe the functionality, organization, and implementation of computer systems. Architecture is decribed as the capabilities and programming model of a computer but not a particular implementation.It involves instruction set architecture design, microarchitecture design, logic design, and implementation.</p>
   <h4> Professor:Dr Anoop Tiwari</h4>
   <p>Here, as i said, I'm already familier with some of the topics but want to know more about that practically and expect to know more terminologies if there.</p>

<center> <h2> Business communication </h2></center>
<p>Business communication encompasses topics such as marketing, brand management, customer relations, consumer behavior, advertising, public relations, corporate communication, community engagement, reputation management, interpersonal communication, employee engagement, and event management. It is closely related to the fields of professional communication and technical communication.</p>
<h4>Professor: Dr Anjuli jain</h4>
<p>Having this subject, I want to make myself more practical, better convincer, and many more for making my personality more better.</p>

   <center><h2> Discrete Mathematics </h2></center>
   <p> Discrete mathematics is the study of mathematical structures that are fundamentally discrete rather than continuous. In contrast to real numbers that have the property of varying "smoothly", the objects studied in discrete mathematics – such as integers, graphs, and statements in logic – do not vary smoothly in this way, but have distinct, separated values. Discrete mathematics therefore excludes topics in "continuous mathematics" such as calculus or Euclidean geometry</p>
   <h4>Professor : Dr Manoj jha and Dr Madhvi Shakya</h4>
   <p>Discrete Maths is sometyhing new for me, but as mathematics is my fav sub from my school days, so it is quite interesting to study and there is very good support of my professors here in learning well new things. Expecting from this subjects, the things which will help in coding and this subject surely good for a coder.</p>

    <h4>Professor : Dr Anirban Choudhary</h4>
    <p>In this Web Development class, I'm excited to learn making webpages more fancier and user friendly, I've studied HTML from my school times, but there all were only few basic things but here I'm learning more than that and expecting that with the completion of my semester, I'm able to design a website with a profesional look.</p>
